# Sentiment_Analysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews dataset using various supervised machine learning models and Financial sentiment analysis using deep learning.

In this project, we implement the following four models for sentiment analysis:

Classical Machine Learning Models
1. Random Forest
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes
3. Decision Tree

BI-LSTM with Word2Vec/FastText Word Embedding
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture contextual information effectively. Word2Vec and FastText are popular word embedding techniques that represent words as dense vectors, capturing semantic meanings. Transformer-Based Model with BERT-Based Word Embedding

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that provides contextualized word embeddings.

Dataset
1. IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets.

2. Financial sentiment datasets which provides financial sentences with sentiment labels.
